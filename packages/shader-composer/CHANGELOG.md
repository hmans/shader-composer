# shader-composer

## 0.0.4

### Patch Changes

- ae36751: Remove `JoinVector2/3/4`. The new `vec2/3/4` helpers do the same thing (but better.)
- ca37b48: Introduce `vec2`, `vec3`, `vec4` helpers as an alternative syntax to their capitalized counterparts. Yes, there are now three ways to construct vectors (`Vec3`, `vec3` and `JoinVector3`), and that's not great. We will eventually consolidate these in a future version.
- c2157ff: We're trying prereleases! Let's go!
- c90ab60: Force high precision in all shaders. (This will be made configurable in a future update.)
