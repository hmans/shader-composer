## 0.0.4-next.1

### Patch Changes

- ca37b48: Introduce `vec2`, `vec3`, `vec4` helpers as an alternative syntax to their capitalized counterparts. Yes, there are now three ways to construct vectors (`Vec3`, `vec3` and `JoinVector3`), and that's not great. We will eventually consolidate these in a future version.
