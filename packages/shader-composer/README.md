## Summary

Write GLSL shaders, but with JavaScript.

> **Warning**
>
> This library is very extremely new. I'd love for you to give it a go and maybe provide some feedback, but I would currently recommend **strongly** against using it in any sort of production project, unless you're ready and willing to keep up with the changes every release. **Use at your own risk.**
